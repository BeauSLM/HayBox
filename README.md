# BubbleBox WASD Firmware

## Usage
The WASD Features added with this version of the firmware are as follows: 2 New gamemodes, and 1 small change to the Default Melee configuration.

The change to the default Melee configuration is that the unused W key is now a D-Pad toggle for the C buttons, and holding ModX + ModY no longer activates the Dpad toggle. This mode, like in the standard firmware, is activated with: Mod X + L + Start

The 2 new gamemode layouts are a Melee Tournament Legal WASD layout, and a non-tournament legal WASD Layout.

The Tournament Legal mode simply swaps the D-Pad toggle and Up keys. So now the movement buttons work like the WASD keys on keyboard, hence the name. And the bottom right pinky button no longer inputs the Up direction and is instead a D-Pad toggle button for the C-Stick inputs. This mode is (currently) Activated with: Mod X + X + Start

The non-tournament legal Layout simply omits the D-Pad toggle, and keeps both buttons as Up. Useful for practicing while you get used to the WASD Layout, or if you don't play competitively. This mode is (currently) Activated with: Mod X + Z + Start

## Other Changes

FGC-mode has been subbed with my Guilty Gear Strive layout, L and A are now Left Stick Press, C-Left is now Right Stick Press.
If Left Stick Press is mapped to the Dash Macro and Right Stick Press is mapped to Roman Cancel Macro, then Dash-Roman-Cancel becomes incredibly easy to execute. The Right and Left triggers and bumpers are now actually mapped to right and left because... left is on the left and right is on the right. If this ends up being a problem, it is easy to revert.

Ultimate, Rivals, and PM modes now all have there W keys enabled.

The Default Keyboard mode and my Strive Keyboard mode now have buttons tied to the W key.
